abstract={This paper outlines the Trinitarian theology of Gregory Nazianzen as a representative of the Byzantine tradition. First, it analyses Gregory's idea of the unfolding of Trinitarian dogma in the course of history. Second, it examines the Trinitarian terminology he uses in his polemics against the Arians. Third, it discusses the divinity of the Trinity. And finally, the paper looks at the vision of dogmatics and the moral implications of the unity of the Holy Trinity. The article comes to conclude that for Gregory, the Holy Trinity was not just a subject of theological controversy, it was primarily an object of prayerful meditation and loving devotion},

 abstract = {According to Plato, Aristotle, and Augustinus, without order beauty is unthinkable. The world is supposed to be in perfect and harmonic order. This conviction could be illustrated by different metaphors: God as an architect who constructed the world as a building; God as a technician who constructed the world as a machine; God as a musician who plays on the world as an instrument; God as a poet who created the world as book or poem. These metaphors will be explained in greater detail in five sections: 1. The sound of the spheres's harmonies: the hypothesis of the physical aspect and its consequences, 2. Kepler or the renunciation of phantasy: the mathematical hypothesis about harmonies and its consequences, 3. Fludd or the world as a monochord: Rosicrucian intuition versus mathematical argumentation, 4. Kircher or the world as an organ: harmonic symbolism, 5. Chimera or remedy: Kepler's research method (empiricism, geometry, existence of God) and Leibniz's and Mersenne's criticism of it.},

 abstract = {The music theory of Leibniz was thought to be by most of the scholars a part of the Pythagorean philosophical tradition. This opinion was maintained without a founded knowledge of the Pythagorean sources nor a proper consideration of the contemporary scientific background, upon which Leibniz wrote. The purpose of this article consists of analysing to what extent the Pythagorean tradition in music theory had still an influence in a philosophical age, whose music had already thoroughly abandoned the main statements of the Pythagoreans. Questions belonging to the Pythagorean conception of music, such as the Tetraktys theory, the number proportions regarding musical intervals and the music of the spheres, are discussed here upon the background of the 17th century music theory. After that, Leibniz' considerations of these subjects turn out to be quite different from those of the Pythagorean tradition. Leibniz criticises it or translates it in an utterly modern language. He proposes a contemporary conception of harmony as an anticipation of beauty through the conjunction of the opposites, which emerges in the music theory of his time and will lead to the aesthetics substituting for the mystic. Dissonance, contrast and mistune are the new concepts to be taken into account.},
