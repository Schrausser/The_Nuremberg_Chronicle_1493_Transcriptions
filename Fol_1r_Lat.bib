 abstract = {Gersonides believed that the material world, which he took to have been created by a voluntary act by the deity, is the best possible one. One aspect of the excellence of the world is the providence the deity exerts over all living beings, perfecting each so as to preserve its existence for the longest possible time. On the most basic level, that of matter, any living being would indeed disintegrate were it not sustained by a power external to matter itself. Gersonides follows a very long tradition, codified notably in Meteorologica 4, holding that all composite substances necessarily decay and corrupt, as a result of the “strife” between their opposing components (elements and qualities). He goes out of his way to emphasize this inherent tendency of composite substances to decay, drawing on Meteorologica 4 much more frequently than most writers. This line of argument is consistent with (or even derives from) his view of the primeval quasi-matter “without form,” which is sheer privation and deficiency, out of which the deity formed the material world. Fortunately, providence counterbalances this built-in tendency of sublunar substances to disintegrate through the influences (programmed at creation) reaching them from the stars. A brief comparison with views of Samuel Ibn Tibbon leads to the argument that Gersonides underscored the theory of matter of Meteorologica 4 in order to aggrandize the role of providence.},

 abstract = {Levi ben Gerson (Gersonides: 1288–1344) included discussions of cosmology in his magnum opus on astronomy (Wars of the Lord, Book V, Part 1). In particular, he addressed issues concerning the arrangement of the planets and their orbs in space. In chapter 29 of this work, Levi argues that the lowest of the set of orbs for each planet moves with the daily rotation and that the planet itself lies on the highest of its set of orbs. He claims that observations of certain phenomena visible in the sky provide evidence for his view and quotes a passage from Book II of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses in support of the principle that the surrounding orb is moved by the orb it encloses. Although Levi took Ptolemy's work as his point of departure, he developed his own theories, which display considerable innovation. An edition of chapter 29 (based on three Hebrew manuscripts), with an English translation, is presented here.},

 abstract = {Levi ben Gerson (Gersonides, d. 1344) was an outstanding medieval astronomer who sought to improve Ptolemy's account of planetary motion both in longitude and latitude. In this article we consider the models he proposed for planetary latitudes. These geometric models are difficult to interpret and the focus here is on the non-technical discussions that surround the descriptions of them, including text, translation, and commentary on chapters 123, 126, and 127 of Levi's Astronomy, One of his themes is that Ptolemy's models are faulty although the data on which they were based are satisfactory. Levi drew on passages in Ptolemy's Almagest and book ii of his Planetary Hypotheses, and commented on them. He noted that, in contrast to Ptolemy's practice in the Almagest of citing dated observations for establishing his theories of planetary longitudes, Ptolemy reported no such dated observations for planetary latitudes. Levi, however, made many dated observations of planetary latitude and they are recorded in chapter 122; but, surprisingly, they are not used at all in the subsequent chapters. Unfortunately, no tables corresponding to Levi's theory of planetary latitudes are extant.},

 abstract = {Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum has endured for reasons quite apart from its usefulness as a reference book. Its genealogies dismember myths as narratives and do little to facilitate reference, but they enact the mingled senses of hope, frustration, and bad faith that characterize early humanist efforts. The extinction of myth both justifies and blocks Boccaccio's quest to restore the genealogy of the old gods in order to revive and legitimize the line of poets. He can safely undertake this quest only if assured of failure. Even then it may not be safe to play Aesculapius to the dismembered corpus of ancient myth. Similar paradoxes emerge from analogies with the Bible and its genealogical mode of history. Finally, the Genealogy's structure imitates the dilemma of the modern poet who, inheriting no authority for his fictions from great antique originals, must press his claim to legitimacy, make it good, perhaps make it up.},

 abstract = {The 1962 publication of J. H. Waszink's edition of Calcidius' commentary on Plato's "Timaeus" focussed attention on the question of Calcidius' source for a group of chapters where he presents an interpretation of Plato's account of the creation of soul. I discuss three attempts to answer this question: that of Waszink himself, who argues that the source is Porphyry who was here influenced by the Neopythagorean/Platonist Numenius, that of J. M. Van Winden, who claims Numenius as the direct source, and that of Werner Deuse, who offers reasons for excluding Numenius as either directly or indirectly responsible. I show the weakness of Deuse's critique, but then argue that neither Waszink nor Van Winden has given sufficient consideration to the possibility that Plotinus, either alone or through Porphyry as intermediary, is behind Calcidius' interpretation, where the doctrines of the unity of the soul and of a higher soul that does not descend, both characteristic of Plotinus' psychology, are prominent. However, there is an important but uniformly overlooked feature of this exegesis that rules out both Plotinus and Porphyry as possible sources. This leaves Numenius as the only serious candidate. If, then, the origin of the doctrines of the unity of the soul and of the undescended higher soul can be traced to the work of Numenius, there is the strong possibility that in his formulation of these same doctrines Plotinus was indebted to Numenius.},
